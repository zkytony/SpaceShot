SpaceShot
=========

Simple full screen space shooting game developed in Java

I wrote this game when I was very curious about how to make Java applets, especially games.  
So I self studied some tutorials At that time it was the first year that I seriously started  
to learn programming. I learnt these before I took my first Computer Science class at the UW  
The code obviously needs improvement, from the standpoint of myself today.  

* At least, it is one of the first projects I did and I felt great about it. *
